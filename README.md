# README Generator

This application was created as an assignment for the UT Full Stack Coding bootcamp. I added ontop of the starter code provided by the bootcamp. While this project is still a work-in-progress, it generates a README file by collecting user input via CLI.

Watch a demonstration of the functional project here:
